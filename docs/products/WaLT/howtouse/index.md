# Wallets service instructions

Move to [Wallet Linking Tool website](https://mywallets.singularitynet.io/)

Connect all your wallets that contain AGIX, both on Ethereum and Cardano and add them to a single collection ID. The total balance of all linked wallets will determine the amount of RJV you are entitled to purchase.

You do need to have at least one Ethereum wallet linked, and you can use this wallet to participate in the TGE.

1. Click on the "connect wallet" button;

2. Select a wallet to connect;

3. Sign the transaction, it does not require payment of commission and is needed to confirm ownership of the wallet;

4. To add additional wallets click on the "connect more" button;

5. To disconnect a wallet from the collection, click the "disconnect" button next to the connected wallet;

When reconnecting to the system, you need to connect at least 1 wallet from the collection, the rest will be connected automatically.

Please note that to add a wallet to the collection, you need to connect at least one wallet from the collection, and then add a new one to it. If a new wallet is initially connected first, it forms an independent collection and cannot be added to an existing collection.

Due to the fact that the Cardano blockchain network is organized differently than Ethereum, when connecting wallets, the system identifies the stake key. The final snapshot will take into account the balances of all stakes linked to the stake key.
