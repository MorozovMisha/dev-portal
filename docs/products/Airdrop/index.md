# Rewarding AGIX Token Holders with New Token Airdrops
As part of SingularityNET's efforts to launch new tokens and projects, we may offer airdrops to reward AGIX token holders. These airdrops are a way to share the value of new spin-off projects with our existing community.

## How It Works:
* **Token Distribution**: A portion of the total supply tokens is reserved for AGIX token holders. These tokens are distributed across different windows, which are specific time periods during which you can claim your rewards.

* **Registration Required**: To claim tokens in each distribution window, AGIX holders must register during that window. This registration is essential to ensure you're eligible to receive the airdropped tokens.

## Who Can Participate:
* The exact eligibility criteria for each airdrop, including which AGIX holders can participate and how much they will receive, will be outlined in the **official announcements** of each spin-off project or token launch.

* Make sure to stay updated through our communication channels for the latest information on upcoming airdrops and eligibility guidelines.

By participating in these airdrops, AGIX holders can benefit from the success and growth of new projects within the SingularityNET ecosystem. Keep an eye out for more details on how to claim your rewards!
