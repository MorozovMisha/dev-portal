As the staking pool starts, the Staking/Withdrawal Period begins and users can send tokens to pool in order to stake them. Tokens aren’t locked in the on-chain script, users can withdraw their deposited amount plus earned rewards in any time during Staking/Withdrawal Period.

Tokens must be deposited <b> before </b> the start of the Staking/Withdrawal Period for which user want to receive a reward.

After the Staking/Withdrawal Period is over, then comes Rewards Distribution Period. For past Staking/Wintdrawal Period in current window the staking rewards are accrued to users, proportionally to their share of the overall staked pool in that period.
