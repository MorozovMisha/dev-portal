# The end of Cardano Staking

The AGIX Cardano staking was completed in September 2024, and awards are no longer awarded due to the ASI Merge.

If you have any difficulties or questions, write to the following email: staking@singularitynet.io

You can migrate to the ASI token (FET) on the Cardano network [here](https://asi-migration.singularitynet.io/)
