# What is the WaLT?

AGIX is a multichain asset available on both Ethereum and Cardano, giving you flexibility and access across networks. Managing your tokens across different wallets can be complex—especially when it comes to processes like voting or airdrops. That’s where the [**Wallet Linking Tool**](https://mywallets.singularitynet.io/) comes in, making your life easier by seamlessly accounting for all your AGIX holdings, without the hassle of managing multiple wallets separately.

## Why Use the Wallet Linking Tool?
* Unified AGIX Balance: Whether you hold AGIX on Ethereum or Cardano, the Wallet Linking Tool automatically consolidates your holdings. This ensures that your total AGIX balance is taken into account for activities like voting or airdrop eligibility, without needing to manually link multiple wallets every time.

* Effortless Participation: The tool simplifies your participation in any voting event hosted by SingularityNET, so you can cast your vote with the full weight of your AGIX holdings across networks.

* Increase Your Voting Power: By linking your **platform ID** to external platforms like [Deepfunding.ai](https://deepfunding.ai), you can directly associate your ID and reputation with your voting activities. This could significantly boost your **voting weight**, making your voice even more impactful within the ecosystem.

## Seamless Integration for Maximum Impact
The Wallet Linking Tool isn’t just a convenience—it’s a powerful way to make sure you’re getting the most out of your AGIX holdings, across all networks and platforms. Whether you’re engaging in governance, claiming airdrops, or building a reputation on partner platforms, this tool streamlines your interactions and maximizes your influence.
