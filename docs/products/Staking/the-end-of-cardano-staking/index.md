# The end of Cardano Staking

The AGIX Cardano Staking was completed in September 2024, and reward are no longer rewarded due to the ASI Merge.

If you have any difficulties or questions, write to the following email: staking@singularitynet.io.

The new windows will no longer be opened, and you can withdraw tokens at any time during the 11 days of the user phase.

You can migrate to the ASI token (FET) on the Cardano network [here](https://asi-migration.singularitynet.io/).
